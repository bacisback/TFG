I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.
